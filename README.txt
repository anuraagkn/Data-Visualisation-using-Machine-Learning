Instructions for running the 'rGrapher' Shiny application, by Anuraag Narang

Currently, the application has only been successfully tested in RStudio.

Running the Shiny application offline in RStudio: 

1) load either ui.R or server.R into the editor.
2) Click the 'Run App' button in the top right corner.

When running the application for the first time, some functions may be masked and the application may not run properly.
Restarting the application should alleviate this issue.
